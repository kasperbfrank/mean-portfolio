            I seek to create bridges between the digital and physical worlds.
            Wether it be through the well established interfaces of today or the interfaces of tomorrow, I push towards rich, meaningful, and beautiful experiences and
            interactions with the world as I believe that these qualities are what distinguishes great IT products from good and mediocre ones.
            I believe in developing with users at the centre by incorporating them as a vital part of the design process. I also believe in agile development processes
            in close relation with stakeholders, where you donâ€™t always end up with the result that you intially envisioned.
